# Youtube_Clone_Backend
-- Use Django REST Framework to build a REST API to serve as the backend for a 
-- YouTube Clone application with JWT user registration and login functionalities.

# Youtube_Clone_Frontend
-- The objective of this project is to leverage modern React features and multiple 
-- external data sources to create a wrapper around the YouTube Data API â€“ creating 
-- a minimal alternative client that exposes only the critical features needed to 
-- enjoy videos! You will also sharpen design skills by crafting a wireframe for the
-- front-end and making your application look as close to the design as possible!
